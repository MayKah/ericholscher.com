Conference in a box
===================

There are a lot of conferences in Portland. Each time someone new wants to start a conference, they have to re-learn all the lessons of how to do it well. They also have to spend the same money on services and assets for the conference. This is anything from lanyrds all the way to solid wifi and a venue. 

I have talked with a few people over the past few months while organizing Write the Docs who want to help solve this problem. A lot of people are scared and intemidated (rightly so) of the act of organizing a conference. I walked into my first conference and organized it for 200 people (with help!). That was definitely a learning experience.

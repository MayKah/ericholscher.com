The things you can't say
========================

I woke up that day,
and couldn't get out of bed.
It took until 11,
hours of picking up my phone,
putting it down,
picking it up,
opening email,
getting overwhelmed,
putting it back down.

It was one of those days...
again.

Thoughts of Finishing
---------------------

Starting a business is hard,
they tell you.
However,
as you go down the path,
you can't talk about it.

You can only speak of failure after you have either already succeeded,
or already failed.
Doubt has no place in leadership,
has no place in ownership,
responsibility is antithetical to doubt.

Yet we soldier on each day,
"killing it",
"doing great",
existing.

I read an `article <>`_ the other day,
it said:

    Silicon Valley is great at seeing the blind spots of other industries,
    but woeful at seeing it's own

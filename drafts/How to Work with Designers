How to Work with Designers
==========================

As a developer,
I find working with a Designer to be the best way to improve my work.
Designers have a fantastic ability to look at things from the viewpoint of a user.
They have greater empathy for the usability of a system.

There is one key to working well with Designers:

	Come to them with a problem instead of a solution

If you are a developer,
this sounds very similar to how you want people to approach you as well.
This is true of most people in creative fields.

When you come to someone with a solution for them to implement,
you are insulting their skillset.
Skilled people are fantastic at building solutions to problems.
A much larger set of people can implement a pre-existing solution.

Involve your designer in the development process early and often.
Allow them to form your understanding of the problems,
and respect their views on usability.

Examples
--------

| Bad: You should make the button blue.
| Good: We need more people to click the button.

| Bad: Can you make the website prettier?
| Good: We are having issues with user retention, how can we help fix this issue?

| Bad: I built the backend, can you make it work well?
| Good: How can we build this system so that it's usable to accomplish our goals.

Conclusion
----------

You need to respect the time and skills of everyone you work with.
Sometimes it can be hard to understand what exactly some folks do,
but defaulting to thinking they are good at what they do.

Involving designers in your planning and design phase of projects is a quick way to get wider perspectives.
It also allows them to bring their skills and viewpoint to improve the solution.

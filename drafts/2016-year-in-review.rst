2016 Year in Review
===================

2016 was an interesting year for a lot of people,
and it wasn't different for me.
I think the overarching view of the year was sustainability.
That was my focus in terms of my businesses,
as well as my general interests and lifestyle.

Focus and Interests
-------------------

My primary focus has been on my two primary business ventures: Read the Docs & Write the Docs.

We had another successful Portland & Prague conference,
which actually made a small profit (if you don't account for the fact we don't really pay for staff).
I have always found conference organization quite stressful,
but this year things have finally started to become a bit more calm.
I still freak out the week before the event,
but having now done 7 events,
it's starting to feel a bit more routine.

Read the Docs as well has been working towards sustainability in a lot of ways.
We introduced a new advertising business model,
which is starting to bare fruit here at the end of the year.
Going into 2017 it's likely going to become a primary driver of our revenue,
and allow myself to finally start making more than $35,000 for the first time in a few years.

I've been learning a lot more about Renewable Energy,
and becoming interested in sustainability of the planet over the long term.
I was heavily inspired by this `blog post`_ by Bret Victor which speaks to how technologists can help with the issues.
I've continued to do research into the Smart Grid and other things,
and feel like I have a more informed view of these issues.

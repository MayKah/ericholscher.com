Documentation as Diversity
==========================

* Beginners
    - It's not a pipeline problem
    - New people are inherently more diverse
    - Tests and reference are for practioners, tutorials & guides are for beginners

* International audiences
    - Translations
    - Fear of interaction

* Communities without docs are full of assholes 
    - Do you want to be a member of a community that doesn't write docs?

Read the Docs Succession Planning
=================================

I've been working on Read the Docs for almost 6 years now.
It's a large part of my professional identity,
the thing that I'm the most known for.
I've always thought I would be happy to work on it forever.
However,
the leaves change color,
the world changes,
and I get older.

At this point,
I have started to feel jaded and less inspired.
I see the problems easier than new solutions,
and don't have the vigor of youth and possibility.
I still firmly believe that the project can do more good in the world,
but I become less convinced that I'm the one to do it over the long term.

Sadly,
I've been failing at growing a community of contributors around the project.
I don't fully understand why that is,
but it's something that I've become more worried about over time.
I don't necessarily have the energy to onboard new people like I used to,
and I want to make sure the project is in good hands for the long term.

So,
this letter is a public recognition of this failing,
and hopefully will also spur action on the part of some kind soul.

Read the Docs needs more people who are willing to work on it.
We need people to do just about everything in the project:

* Translation management
* Operations and Infrasturcture work
* Documentation updates and improvements
* Support and GitHub ticket triage
* Design and UX updates and improvements
* Development of new features and new ideas
* Promotion of the project with blogging and social media

Just about anything that someone could be needed is needed.
We've had a lack of interest in development on the project for a long time,
and as such things have languised.

Get Involved
------------

We have a well-documented process for getting involved in the tickets:

* http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute.html

We also have hundreds of possible projects that can be done from the operations and development side.

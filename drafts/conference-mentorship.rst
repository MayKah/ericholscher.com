Conference Mentorship
=====================

I have had the oppertunity to provide mentorship to folks who have organized conferences a few times in the past couple years.
Through this process I have realized the value in this practice,
and I'd like to write this to promote others to do to same for first year conference organizers.

I think this is a practice that would be very valuable to build inside the global Pycon & Write the Docs community conferences.

How to mentor
-------------

The most recent experience I had was doing this as PyCascades.
Looking back,
I would say the role could be defined as this:

* Provide a working example of major documents that a conference needs (budget, volunteer & organizer schedules, sponsorship prospectus, conference schedule)
* No major organizational tasks would be assigned to me
* Provide perspective when people had questions about how to do something, or were freaking out over small details that wouldn't matter. Focus the group on the right problems.
* Play part-time cheer leader. Reminding people that we were **doing great at something really hard**, much better than a first-year conference had any right to be doing.


The value provided
------------------

The total time commitment,
outside of attending the conference,
was around **20 hours**.
I helped save a good deal more time for the other organizers.

The major parts of this were:

* Having a starting point to work from, instead of creating things from scratch
* Stopping additional work from happening that didn't need to happen
* Reducing the amount of time spent stressing out over things

You should be a mentor
----------------------

If you have organized a conference before and have a good grasp on the operations,
you should help mentor another conference.
It's one of the highest leverage ways you can spend your time,
if your goal is to help expand a community in the real world.

Next steps
----------

I'd also love to open source the basic documents that I provided to the organizers of PyCascades from my work on Write the Docs.
I think having a shared repository of basic conference starting documents would go a long way to making this a scalable system of organizing conferences,
and allowing mentors to learn from each other over time.
It's all the same value that we get from open sourcing code,
but for building a community in real life!

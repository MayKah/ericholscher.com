Teaching is Harder than Doing
=============================

In order to write Documentation,
you need to be able to understand a system,
and then explain it in simple words.

Most people would agree that teaching something is harder than the initial creation of that thing.
I know that I need to understand something at a deeper level to teach it than to use it.
Questions have a way of finding exactly what you don't know :)

However,
when it comes to documentarians,
technical writers,
and other conveyers of information,
this concept seems to flip on its head.
Now,
it is the creator and the user of technology who has the harder job.

I,
for one,
fully think that cogently documenting a software system takes a good deal more skill than creating it in the first place.
It's time that we give proper credit to those who explain our creations,
not just pat ourselves on the back for making them.

If nobody knows how to use the thing you made,
how can it possibly make a difference?

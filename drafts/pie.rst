A slice of PIE
==============

It all started on the top of Mount St. Helens.
After a full day of hiking to the top,
it was time to head down.
The best part of every mountain climbing adventure,
glissading.
A glorified word for sliding down on your butt.

`Anthony`_ and I had successfully climbed a volconoe,
and this was the beginning of a partnership where we would attempt to do something much harder;
start a company.

Read the Docs entered `PIE`_ in August of 2014 with the goal of creating a way to make the project sustainable.
An open source project I helped found over four years ago,
it had grown beyond my wildest dreams.
In the past year we've had over 30 million people view documentation on the site,
from every country in the world.
In that time I've managed to make about $1000/mo from donations.

The Portland Incubator Experiment, fondly known as PIE, was where we decided to make that dream a reality.

Why I'm building a company: Parks and Libraries
===============================================

The United States is a beautiful country.
We invented the concept of a `National Park`_ just to preserve some of our land.

The United States has a beautiful heritage.
We have the `largest library in the world`_.

Portland is a beautiful place.
We have one of the largest `parks`_ and `most used libraries`_ in the country.

It seems silly to build a company here,
and not make use of the amazing public resources at our disposal.

Mission
-------

Read the Docs is a for-profit company.
However,
we still have a mission that is focused on the public good.
We also registered at a `Benefit Corporation`_ for this reason.

We view ourselves very much in the heritage of a library.
We hold information and make it available to millions of people,
every day,
for free.

Our public lands aren't protected if we don't use them.
By making better use,
in varied and creative ways,
allows us to protect the land that we should really care about.

Instead of an office,
we work from parks and libraries.

Perks
-----

Keep things simple they say.
Our office provides everything that an office should:

* Toilets
* Running Water
* Shelter
* Power

Turns out we don't really need that much.

Structure
---------

Not having an office allows you to rethink :doc:`structure <why-im-building-a-company-structure>` in your company in other fundamental ways.
We're just getting started,
but I'm really excited to build a different company than has previously existed.

We might end up with an office some day,
but I sure hope you'll never call us *normal*.

Technical Writing is the Most Important Skill for a Software Developer
======================================================================

Writing words is 80% of the job of software development.
You have:

* Emails
* Commit Messages
* Issues
* README's
* Chat
* Twitter
* Documentation
* Requirements documents
* Code Comments

These are all written parts of the software development process.
This is all communicating with other humans.
You need to be able to communicate with your team to build software.

It doesn't matter how deep your technical knowledge of a topic is,
if you are building the wrong product.
In order to understand what to build,
to communicate effectively with your team,
requires a mastery of the written word.

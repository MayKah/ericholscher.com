Funding Digital Infrastructure
==============================

Read the Docs is a library.
We host documentation for over 30,000 software projects.
Over 35 million people use it every year.
This would easily qualify as one of the larger `libraries`_  in the country.

Luckily,
we don't have to carry expensive books,
just bits.
However,
we are operating a website that is used at all hours of the day.
We wear pagers,
we respond to emails at GitHub issues,
and all of this is unpaid.

I've been doing it now for over 5 years,
and for the past 3 years full time.

Ignore Job Requirements
========================

I often talk with people who will self-select themselves out of jobs that they are qualified for.
They see the list of "job requirements" and if they don't match every single one,
they assume they aren't qualified.

Here is a secret:

**Most job requirements are a list of "nice to haves", not requirements**. Almost nobody in the world will be able to check every box.

Go do those things that you don't think you're qualified for. That's the only way to grow into the person you want to be, and advance in your career.

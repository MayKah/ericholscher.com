Documentation as Empathy
========================

Documention helps us all
------------------------

Documenting your code is a good thing for everyone.
Historically I have approached this problem with why its good for people like me,
who know how to code,
and want to build a community.

Documentation also serves other roles in the community of programming,
and I would like to talk about that today.

By writing good documentation,
you improve the experience of everyone who interacts with your project.

Language Barrier

Travel Story
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine you are traveling to a foreign country.
You wake up at 5 in the morning,
before the sun has risen to heat the day.
Pull yourself out of the cacoon of warmth from the night before.
You get dressed,
pull together your travel bags,
check one more that you haven't forgotten anything important.

You brain is hardly working,
you just want to make sure you don't miss your flight.

Fast forward 12 hours,
and you arrive in Budapest for this very conference.
The plane lands hard on the deck in the pouring down rain.
You haven't eaten since some stale snack food you've had on the train.
You take a cab to your hotel,
exhausted,
you toss your luggage on the bed.

You have no real idea what time it is,
you just know that you haven't eaten in too damn long.

You walk out into the city,
slightly disoriented,
not really sure where to go.
Life is happening all around you,
but something about it seems different.
You realize that nobody is speaking your language.

You are adrift.

All of the food in the store windows is different than you're used to.
You eventually stumble onto a vendor who has something that looks famillar,
and you purchase it through a serious of grunts and pointing.
You then retreat back to your hotel room,
exhausted.

The fear of interaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the above story illistrates,
it can be disconcerting and scary to interact with people.
Especially when there is a sizable language and culture barrier.

When you have good documentation,
it reduces the stress involved in learning.
If people have to ask questions or interact with humans to get answers,
that can be incredibly stressful for someone who isn't a native speaker.

Another benefit is that when you have written something down,
the documentation can be translated.
Things like Google Translate do a decent job,
and at least can get people to a basic level of understanding without knowing english.

**If you don't have comprehensive documentation written down,
people who don't speak english can not use your project.**

Beginner Empathy
----------------

It's incredibly difficult to empathize with someone who is new,
someone who is different than you.

Documentation is like a welcome mat
-----------------------------------

When a beginner comes to use your project,
you should be as welcoming as possible.
Documentation is an incredibly important way to be approachable and welcoming.

Not being welcoming is perpetuating a white and male hegemony
-------------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: This is the part people don't want to hear.

If you are not welcoming to beginners,
you are perpetuating the status quo of a society.
This is structural,
and true of all socieities.
It is in our nature to be distrustful of outsiders,
to keep close tribal ties with people we know.
If we want to make the programming community more inclusive,
we need to proactively reach out and welcome beginners.

The current open source world is that it is heavily weighted white,
male,
and wealthy.
If we as a group don't actively try and change the sturcture of our community,
it will stay this way.

Not being welcoming means there are more assholes
-------------------------------------------------

When there isn't an obvious and easy path into a community,
a lot of people don't make it into being members.
The flip side of this is to examine who will become a member of this community.

What attributes would a person have to learn a software project that isn't welcoming:

* Intelligent
* Stubborn
* "Alpha"
* Paid (Has some external motivator)

As you might notice, 
the programming community has a lot of stubborn people.
That is because it takes a stubborn person to use most of the software we currently make.

How can I help
--------------

* Don't use software that isn't documented.
* Make your projects friendly to beginners
	* Have a tutorial and documentation that is focused on people who are new
	* Provide links to resources for people to learn more about the domain your project exists in.

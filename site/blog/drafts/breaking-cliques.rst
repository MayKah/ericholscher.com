Breaking Cliques at Events
==========================

I've been going to professional events for a number of years,
and one of the trickiest dynamics I have seen is that most events develop an "insiders" group who has been going for a long time.
These groups tend to feel like exclusionary cliques for first-time attendees,
and actively hurt the community's goal of inclusion.

I'd like to propose a simple rule that we have at the `events <http://www.writethedocs.org/>`_ I run,
which I think makes inclusion easier for everyone.

The Responsibility to *Meet New People*
---------------------------------------

Meeting new people is scary, especially if you're new to a community and you're not sure if you belong.
People that have been attending an event for years are much more firmly planted in the community,
and also have the ability to help newcomers understand the norms and practices of a place.

**This means the primary responsibility to meet new people should be on the long-time attendees, not first-time attendees**.

With that in mind,
I drafted a new concept that I think assigns the responsibility properly.

Our new rule
------------

The rule is simply stated:

    For every year you have attended the event, you must meet that many new people each day.

An example makes it clear:
    
    If you have attended this event for **three** years, you must meet **three** new people each day.

Outcomes
--------

In the events that I have run, this rule has turned out quite well.
I have gotten a lot of feedback of people turning it into a game:
"My friends and I competed to see how many new people we could meet each day"

This also gives newcomers a job an attainable goal as well.
Just meet one new person each day.
That feels like an attainable goal that anyone can meet.

However, the most important outcome is how it changes the dynamic of the event itself.
**It goes from an event where it feels like people aren't accessible, to one where people know it's their job to meet new people.**
This makes it easier for everyone to meet new people,
make connections,
and really build the valuable professional networks that we all need to be happy in our careers.
